## Overview
Grumpy cat is looking for a new job! Using what you know about HTML and CSS, help him by creating a resume website for him. (Note: You don't need to know 'real information' about Grumpy Cat -- just make things up!)

## Getting Started
- `Fork` and `clone` this repository
- `cd` into the directory on your local machine
- Create an `index.html` and `main.css` file and make sure they are linked together
- Once these files are created and linked, run `open index.html` to open the website in your browser and `cmd + option + i` (MacOS) or `ctrl + shift + i` (Windows/Linux) to open your dev tools

This is what he wants you to include and do for his resume:

- have an `index.html` file
- have an `main.css` file that is linked to the `index.html` file
- have HTML `boilerplate` code for `index.html`
  - _HINT:_ in your `index.html` file type `html` or `!` and press tab. A few basic HTML tags should populate your file, including `head` and `body`
- Include:
  - at least one header
  - navigation (these can be dummy links that don't go anywhere yet)
  - at least one list
  - change the font color in at least one place
  - change the background in at least one place
  - change the font in at least one place



## Adding Content
1. Insert a professional image of Grumpy Cat ('img' tag), it should be placed right after your 'h1' tags
1. Insert an unordered list of his past three work positions ('ul' tag)
1. Create links for LinkedIn and Facebook/Twitter pages ('a' tag). You can set this to a dummy link
1. Use level-three heading tags to create headings before the work positions and before the links

## Adding Style
Add some style to your site and feel free to style it however you want! Here are some ideas:

1. Center your "h1" tag
1. Change the font of your "h1" tag
1. Change the color of the font of your "h3" tag
1. Add some space on the body of your application to make your site look more appealing.
